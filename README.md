# Decription 
In this project, I wrote an implentation that detect an object on a particular image given a picture of that object. There are six methods that I use in total provided by open-cv libabry. 

For this project, I followed open-cv documentation/tutorial here:
https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/df/dfb/group__imgproc__object.html
https://opencv24-python-tutorials.readthedocs.io/en/latest/py_tutorials/py_imgproc/py_template_matching/py_template_matching.html
